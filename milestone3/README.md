## Spring Semester – 2022

## 1 Assignment Goal

The goal of this assignment is to help you understand and analyze the main
components of a senior project. This can help you later to understand, analyze,
develop, and improve your own senior design project.

## 2 Tasks for this assignment

When you enroll in senior projects you will be required to complete various
tasks. Tasks for this assignment are:

- Approach afaculty memberwho could help guide you through the suc-
    cessful completion of a senior project.
       - Ask if they have a project you could work on.
       - If you have a project in mind, explain it to them and ask for their
          feedback.

```
If you don’t get the help you need, approach another member of the faculty.
Repeat as needed.
```
- In senior projects you will be required to write several software engineering
    documents that describe what is to be done for your project and how you
    plan to do it. Dr. Chan has an excellent collection of guidelines and other
    resources to help students successfully complete a senior project: See his
    projects page and read these documents:
- Guidelines for Role of Faculty Sponsors
- Guidelines for a Project Plan
- Guidelines for your Project Web Sites
- Guidelines for Milestone Progress Evaluations
- Guidelines for Requirement, Design, Test Documents
- Guidelines for Scores for Teammates
- Guidelines for Demo Video and User/Developer Manual
- the intellectual Property policies in the Student Handbook
- the intellectual Property policies in the Faculty Handbook
- the COES Student Design And Research website
- Write a report based on your interviews an readings following this outline:
    1. Your name.
    2. The names of faculty member(s) you approached.
    3. Did they have projects they were interested in having you help? If
       so, summarize their project(s).
    4. Did you tell them about a project you would like to do? If so, what
       was their reaction?
    5. Based on your reading of the Guidelines, the intellectual policies in
       the student and faculty handbooks, and exploring the college web
       site for design and research write a paper that describes what you
       have learned and will be useful to you in creating your own senior
       project.
    6. Describe one or more projects you would like to pursue as a senior.
       Do you have teammates?

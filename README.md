### Title IX

The Patsy Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, AKA Title IX:

```
Suggested	Syllabus	Language
J.	Oglesby: 02/06/


What	is	Title	IX?
Title	IX	of	the	Educational	Amendments	Act	of	1972	is	the	federal	law
prohibiting	 discrimination	based	on	sex	under	any	education	program
and/or	activity	operated	by	an	institution	receiving	and/or	benefiting
from	federal	financial	assistance.


Behaviors	that	can	be considered	“sexual	discrimination”	include	sexual
assault,	sexual	harassment,	stalking,	relationship	abuse	(dating	violence
and	domestic	violence),	sexual	misconduct,	and	gender	discrimination.
You	are	encouraged	to	report	these	behaviors.
Reporting
Florida	Tech	can	better	support	students	in	trouble	if	we	know	about
what	is	happening.		Reporting	also	helps	us	to	identify	patterns	that
might	arise	– for	example,	if	more	than	one	complainant	reports	having
been	assaulted	or	harassed	by	the	same	individual.
Florida	Tech	is	committed	to	providing	a	safe	and	positive	learning
experience.		To	report	a	violation	of	sexual	misconduct	or	gender
discrimination,	please	contact	Security	at	321- 674 - 8111.	 *	Please	note
that	as	your	professor,	I	am	required	to	report	any	incidences	to
Security or	to	the	Title	IX	Coordinator	(321- 674 - 8700). For	confidential
reporting,	please	contact	CAPS	at	321- 674 - 8050.

Fanak Baarmand has the position of Title IX Coordinator for the
university. All incidents or complaints concerning Title IX policy
violations should be referred to her.

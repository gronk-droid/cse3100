## 1 Assignment Goal

The goal of this assignment is to help you belong to a team either as a leader
or a player. Google the terms “team leader” and “team player” to learn about
these roles and get advice onteamwork.
In particular, for this course, learn how to use tools that support software
development and collaboration. Here is a partial list of tools you may want to
use.

- Discord Students have introduced me to Discord To quote from the dis-
    cord site “Whether you’re part of a school club, gaming group, worldwide
    art community, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time to-
    gether, Discord makes it easy to talk every day and hang out more often.”
    However, Discord does not directly support software development.
- Microsoft teams
    Find resources to learn aboutMicrosoft Teams. You can access Teams
    software through the Florida Tech web site
- GitHub is perhaps the default site for collaborative software development.
    GitHub You should be able to find resources to learn aboutGitHub.
- There are many other tools to help collaboration in the development of
    computer science/software engineering solutions to problems. If there is
    some you like let me know.

## 2 Tasks for this assignment

- Form a team of 2 or 3 students enrolled in this course. (A team of 4
    may be allowed but must be justified and approved by the instructor
    wds@cs.fit.edu)

```
wds@cs.fit.edu.
```


```
Here is some advice on forming a team.
```
- As a team, write a report following this outline:
    1. Your name
    2. Your teammates’ names
    3. Did you consider using development tools other than ones mentioned
       above? If so, what were they?
    4. Describe the team work tool you and your teammates have decided
       to use. If there are multiple opinions, outline them.
    5. Why did you chose the soft development tool you plan to use in senior
       projects?

## 3 Submitting your report

Your report must be double-spaced, written using 12-point font, with 1-inch
top, bottom, left & right margins, stored in PDF format, and submitted on the
Canvas Learning management system. I expect each team member to submit
the same report.

## 1 Assignment Goal

The goal of this assignment is to help you understand and analyze the main
components of a senior project by interacting with students who are completing
their project. This can help you later to understand, analyze, and improve your
own senior design project.

## 2 Tasks for this assignment are

- Select a current senior project from Dr. Shoaff’s current senior projects
    class (project websites with contact info) [each student should choose a

    the number of projects in wds’s Senior Projects]
    You may also contact students in Dr. Chan’s class. Visit Dr. Chan’s Senior
    Project page. A wealth of information on projects resides there that you
    will need for future assignments in this course.
